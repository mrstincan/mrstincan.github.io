It really put into perspective how many people truly lived in the city, and how terribly bad the earthquake was. Her whole body felt sore and her mind dizzy from all the hard work at the clinic, but she couldn&#39;t stop yet. On the way back to the guild, she could only think about one thing: Ashe. How was he feeling? How severe were his injuries? Would his injuries worsen as he helped?

The worries lead her to the guild at a fast pace, faster than her thought could run. Before she knew, she was surrounded by the usual bunch at a time like this, and soon, in front of Ashe&#39;s door. Only then did she realise how fast her heart was breathing and how heavy she was breathing. She really put in a sprint to get back, huh?

A few deep breaths later, Annette knocked on his door, loud and clear. Of course it was late, and she&#39;d hate to wake him, but under the circumstances of wanting to make sure he&#39;s OK, she needed him awake. Knowing he was taken care of and healed would certainly help her sleep better at night, regardless of how exhausted she had been from the work at the clinic. <em>She would definitely return tomorrow.</em>

Nervously, she knocked once more. &quot;It&#39;s me, Annette. Ashe, are you there?&quot;

While he didn’t have many of his own belongings, the room had been furnished even before his arrival, including a full bookcase, several lamps, and a dresser full of basic clothes, all of which he had spent the past hour picking up off the floor after the earthquake brought everything that wasn’t nailed in place (and many things that were) crashing down. 

He hadn’t managed to put everything back in its place, but after an already long day, his only goal had just been to make the room livable, a task which he felt he had accomplished satisfactorily. He had already more or less exhausted all his energy scrambling around rubble all day, all the while nursing wounds that were perhaps a bit more severe than he had let on over his text conversation with Annette:

During the earthquake, a piece of rubble had fallen in front of him, landing on his foot, likely breaking one or two of his toes in the process… But he felt fine! Mostly. It was still a far cry from the worst injuries people had experienced that morning, and he knew he would only be taking time and attention from other patients if he went into the clinic. Besides, If he had visited the clinic, he knew Annette would never let him go out and help with the rescue efforts. His foot would be fine, he just had to be careful!

Naturally, after he finished tidying his room, he was just about ready to pass out, but he held off on lying down knowing Annette was likely on her way to check on him. He didn’t have to wait long before he heard her knocking on the door, and he jumped up to answer it. “Annette! It’s good to see you!” he said, trying to hide his wince from putting weight on his injured foot.

Quickly she ran her fingers through her hair in an attempt to comb out the messy state it was in before tugging at her clothes to look less dishevelled. The soft smile she had prepped on her face did not last long as it faded as soon as the door opened and she saw the damage the room itself had taken. It was to be expected that the earthquake would shake things up, but she had completely blanked on this. It almost made her jaw drop. <em>Did her room get wrecked too? Maybe even worse? Most likely.</em>

&quot;Oh... Oh my.&quot; She recognised the traces of things being cleaning up, though some heavier things and wall mounted shelves seemed out of place. Annette blinked a few times. <em>She really did not want to know what her room looked like now.</em> A moment passed before she turned her attention back to what - or rather who - she came for. &quot;Ah- where does it hurt? Tell me what happened and I&#39;ll get right to healing!&quot; As best as she could at least. After all, her healing magic would just accelerate the healing to an extend and not fully, unless she would spend a great amount of time and energy on her spell. At least it would ease the pain for the time being. <em>Oh if only Mercy was here...</em>

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect the earthquake to cause such a mess - not that its your fault how your room looks, it isn&#39;t! It makes me wonder what everyone else&#39;s rooms look like... I&#39;ll heal you first, I can worry about the rooms later...&quot;

He could immediately tell the disheveled state the room was in had caught her attention, and he felt a slight pang of self consciousness. He knew it wasn’t his fault the room was like that, and he did the best he could to pull everything together with the energy he had, but he still felt embarrassed showing the mess to Annette. 

However, her question managed to pull his attention away from the embarrassment he felt about the condition of his room, and redirected it to the embarrassment he felt about his injury. “Er… You see… The earthquake woke me up of course, and as I was going outside to scope out what was going on, a piece of rubble dropped on my right foot from some height. I really don’t know how I could be so clumsy as to not notice it until it actually hit me…” His face turned a subtle shade of red as he looked away, avoiding eye contact with Annette. 


Ashe knew she was not the type to jump to judging people or criticizing them when this sort of misfortune befalls them - she was about as far from that as a person could get - but he still felt a bit ashamed explaining to Annette what happened. “It’s really no big problem, I was able to walk around just fine the rest of the day! I’m sorry to worry you about something so small…” His foot was NOT, in fact, ok. He could tell he had at least broken at least his big toe, as well as probably damaging the rest of his toes as well for good measure, and it had hurt like hell walking around on it all day, but he had hoped underselling his injury could convince Annette not to worry about him quite as much. Clearly this tactic was not really working though…

Oh no. The debris was heavy. She had seen the damage it had done to the people in the clinic... and Ashe was only wearing leather boots!! He must have been hurting this entire time!!! &quot;Nonsense!&quot; Carefully, Annette grabbed a hold of Ashe&#39;s hand and guides him to his bed, forcing him to sit down. &quot;Big or small, injury is injury! Besides- You were walking around with this?! Unbelievable!! That could make it worse!&quot; After pushing Ashe down, she lifts his legs on top of the bed, sitting down besides him to block him from trying to escape his preliminary bedrest.

Without further ado, she quickly but carefully removes his shoes to check the damage that had been done- and <em>what</em> damage had been done. &quot;Ashe! Goddess!&quot; The swelling and bruising definitely indicated broken bones. <em>You kindhearted fool...</em> Annette sighed softly. The work at the clinic has been testing her magic reserves, but she was not yet fully drained of them. Lifting a hand to hover over Ashe&#39;s injured foot, sigils of light begin to glow as she focused her healing magic. It would not heal immediately, she did not have enough magic for a powerful spell as that nor was she awake enough to concentrate on anything more demanding of her right now. For now, she kept exposing the injury to her healing magic, slow and steady, the swelling would reduce at least, though the broken bone would take a little longer.

He was helping in times of a crisis despite his injury. It was a noble and knightly thing to do - <em>but it was still somewhat stupid.</em>

I’m fine!” His protests were undercut by his very obvious wince of pain as she removed his shoe. He wanted to tell her not to expend so much of her magic reserves on him, but at this point it was simply too obvious how little difference his words would make, so he sat silently as she treated his injury, still avoiding looking her in the eye. 

A moment passed after Annette aired her complaints before Ashe spoke up. “...I’m sorry Annie, I should have told you what happened sooner… I knew you wouldn’t want me walking around like this, but I couldn’t stand the thought of sitting still when I could be helping… I just didn’t want you to worry, but it’s clear that I’ve only made you worry more.” With those last few words, he finally managed to look his friend in the eyes, giving her a look of worry of his own. “I really do appreciate you coming here to help me, but are you sure you can afford to expend so much energy on this…? You seem really exhausted… I’m sure I can’t convince you to stop helping, but at least tell me you’ll take some time to rest after this.”

Part of her thought the only thing really keeping her away right now was her heart beating rapidly like a bird caged behind her ribcage, fuelled by by her worry for him, <s>almost as if it wanted to jump out right into his hands.</s> The thought made her blush slightly and she took a moment to scan Ashe&#39;s face for further injuries. Splinters, scratches, anything really! The moment their eyes suddenly met caught her off guard. The heart that was fluttering in her chest skipped a single beat, her magic faltering only slightly, and for that moment, Annette didn&#39;t even notice she was holding her breath. 

<em>Exhale.</em> A coy smile paints her lips as she looks away. &quot;I&#39;m ok. Yes, I am exhausted, but that&#39;s alright.&quot; Slowly, she could feel her magic dwindling. Had she really dipped into all of her reserves? A defeated sigh passes her lips though it does not break her smile. The light cast by her magic was slowly dimming before it disappeared as she retreats her hands and lets them fall into her lap. &quot;That&#39;s all I can do for now... sorry Ashe. I&#39;ll come back tomorrow morning for another healing session, ok?&quot; After those words, Annette stretched her arms into the air, biting back a quiet whimper before turning her attention back to Ashe. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll get some rest, but you have to promise me too, ok?&quot; If there was one thing she did not want it would be for her friends to get even more hurt.

Almost as if in an instinct, Annette throws herself at Ashe for a hug, burying her face in his shoulder. As she would speak, her voice was muffled, but still clear enough to be heard. &quot;I was <em>really</em> worried, Ashe. Please be more careful- or tell me right away when you&#39;re hurt, ok?&quot; Her eyelids felt heavy, tempted to fall shut as she found comfort in resting her head on him. It was almost... tempting her to doze off... <em>No, Annette! Snap out of it!</em> As if electrified, her body tenses for just a second before she pushed herself off of her friends shoulder, awkwardly rubbing her tired eyes. &quot;Ah-- S..sorry... I don&#39;t know what came over me... I should get back to my room and check out the chaos before I catch some rest.&quot; If she was lucky, maybe everything <em>just fine.</em> Maybe it was just a toppled over bookshelf. Maybe she could just fall into her bed... <em>Maybe.</em>

It was really kind of you to come all the way here just for me. I promise I’ll take tomorrow to rest. The last thing I want is to worry you any more than I already have…” The blushing continued as he looked at the ground again and subconsciously reached his arm up to scratch the back of his neck, a sort of nervous instinct taking over his actions. Under normal circumstances, Ashe would have no qualms about saying something so sappy and earnest, but being alone with Annette made him all the more self conscious about every word he said and how it could be interpreted. 

As these superfluous thoughts flooded his mind, he was distracted enough to be completely caught off guard when Annette suddenly lunged at him. There was a long moment after she wrapped her arms around him that he could do nothing but sit still, stunned, holding his arms in the air above her as his mind completely blanked on what to do with them. It was not until she began to speak that he finally found his bearings and relaxed his arms, returning the hug. Having buried her head in his shoulder, Annette could not have noticed that his freckled face was now about as bright red as was physically possible. 

“O-Of course, I promise… I promise I’ll tell you next time… I’m sorry I worried you so much…”

He could feel her almost melting in his arms with how hard she was struggling to stay awake. For a moment he found himself almost welcoming the idea of her falling asleep then and there - <em>No! No! Quit it! What kind of knight are you?! Get ahold of yourself!</em> He managed to snap himself back to reality just in time for her to suddenly pull herself away, much to his simultaneous disappointment and relief.

“R-Right! Your room!

The heat was rising to her cheeks, letting a soft pink blush bloom on them. After such a rough day, not even her makeup survived to hide the blush. How rude of her to almost fall asleep on him... <em>but it was so comfortable.</em> Heart racing once more, Annette pushed some hair out of her face, trying to ignore the feelings that were dwelling inside of her. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine... I guess. Getting there is not the issue... but...&quot; A surprisingly heavy sigh leaves her lips as she took a moment to look around the room.

&quot;I don&#39;t exactly know what state my room was in. I would have to clean it immediately... what if something fell on my bed? Would I even be able to get it off?&quot; There&#39;s no way she <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> clean her room if she was it in shambles... but she was just too exhausted. Resting her face against her hand, Annette closed her eyes and thought about what mess her room would be in. <em>I&#39;d much rather just stay here if I could</em>, she thought to herself, unaware that her thoughts escaped her in a quiet mumble. Another heavy sigh follows, forcing itself into a yawn that she would quickly cover. 

As she got up from his bed, Annette stretched her arms up in the air, prompting a few of her joints to pop quietly. <em>Ouch.</em> &quot;If you need anything else, let me know. hm... I should get you some water... let me see, do I still have painkillers...?&quot;

No, I must’ve misheard her… Right?!</em> As she turned back to face him again he awkwardly shifted his gaze in an attempt to look casual, but there was still nothing he could do about the blood rushing to his face. 

“Oh! Um… No need to worry about that! I’ve got some water already and I’ll be fine without painkillers! Um… I know you don’t want me to strain myself, but if you need any help getting your room in livable shape, please do let me know! After all, you need rest as much as I do, so it’s better if we both work together and save time and energy than if you just did it all yourself and hurt yourself in the process…” If all it had taken for her to fall asleep had been a few seconds in his arms, she clearly was even more tired than he was. Surely she wouldn’t last long trying to clean her room… The last thing he wanted was for her to work herself to the point of passing out on the floor. 

The way this exchange had gone so far, he was sure Annette would put up some resistance to his offer, but he had to try to help. Ashe tousled his hair nervously, awaiting the inevitable response.

Well, she can&#39;t blame him, really, she was just like that. Besides, it was one of the qualities why she liked him so much... Her gaze would linger on his face a little too long, noticing how... <em>unusually red</em> it was. &quot;Your face...&quot; Quickly, she removed her gloves, walking closer to cup Ashe&#39;s face in her hands and check his temperature. &quot;No way!

I&#39;ll just find somewhere else to sleep...&quot; Pushing Ashe back, further into his bed, Annette gently pushed the hair out of his face to place the handkerchief on his forehead. &quot;Like the common room... there&#39;s some armchairs there... I could sleep on those...&quot; Though the sudden <em>fever</em> made her a little worried. Perhaps she should stay here to keep an eye on him?

A fever...? Wait, wait, what makes you think I have a fever?! Annie, hold on, I’m fine, please!” Ashe fell back into his bed, too stunned to resist… whatever it was that was happening. Sure, he may have understated the severity of his foot injury earlier, but he really didn’t think he was experiencing a fever! <em>Then again, what do I know about medicine…? I suppose it’s not unrealistic for her to have noticed something wrong before I have. After all, she’s the one with medical experience…</em> 

He didn’t fight it as Annette put her handkerchief on his forehead - he still wasn’t sure what was wrong, but somehow that just made him more concerned - but he couldn’t help but protest when she mentioned alternatives to sleeping in her room: “Armchairs?! You can’t be serious… After such a long day you need good rest just as much as I do! Please, let me help you work out a better solution… I don’t want you waking up with a backache tomorrow just because you wouldn’t let me get out of bed…”

You&#39;re burning up! Especially your cheeks.&quot; As she said it, her hands would move from the handkerchief to cup his face again. Fingertips still damp from the wet handkerchief. Perhaps that would help cool him down a little. &quot;You seriously have me worried, Ashe.&quot; Thoughts drifting away, her fingertips gently stroked his cheeks before she snapped out of it again, her own cheeks burning up at the realisation of how close she had been the entire time. Pulling her hands back, she pushed her hair behind her ears with a shy smile. &quot;Ah--- s-sorry I&#39;m... I know... I know... I&#39;m a little much today-- When you work with stubborn injured people the whole day, you just have to force some to take a rest, haha...&quot;

<s>Someone needs to force her to rest.</s> &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; His comment made her raise her hands in defence. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.

She should go get a chair now or she might fall asleep then and there!

She’s just being nice! She treats everyone this way. Why am I getting so flustered about it?</em> But just as all this was going through his mind, Annette cups his face in her hands, forcing his brain into another hard reset. He didn’t need a mirror to know his “fever” was only getting worse by the minute… 

What could he even do about it!? How does one get oneself to stop blushing!? Why was any of this even bothering him in the first place? It was nearly impossible for him to make sense of all the thoughts running through his head. Thoughts about what it might mean that she’s being so seemingly affectionate with him… But clearly he was just reading into things too much, right?! They were friends, of course she’d be worried about him, and all she’s been doing is taking care of him like she would any patient! Besides, it had been a while, but they’d been in similar situations before even back when they were in school together. She’s always been like this.

Truly a battle of two stubborn people of remarkable stubbornness! It seemed a lost battle, one that would never end, if Annette would have had the energy to continue insisting she&#39;s fine. Another yawn escaped her. Looks like she was losing both battles here. After a serious pout pursed her lips, Annette sighed in defeat. &quot;<em>Fine...</em> I will go check on my room, <em>on my own</em>, while you stay here. No walking around, got it?&quot; She lifts a finger threateningly, but for a woman of her stature and beauty it looked more cute than anything else. A perk that would often come in handy on the battlefield when she defended her uncle&#39;s estate.

With that, she stands up, stretching once more before turning towards the door. &quot;If I don&#39;t come back, don&#39;t come looking for me. My room will most likely be fine then, got it? You need to rest!&quot; A moments hesitation as she reaches for the doorknob, looking at Ashe and scanning the room again, worried she might have forgotten something. He had water, he was healed <em>to some degree</em>, he just needed rest. Walking out of the door, she felt almost sad she had to leave. As much as she wished her room was intact, as well as her bed, part of her wanted an excuse to go back- <em>No, no! No! No no no no no no! Ashe needs to rest. If your room is ruined, just sleep downstairs in one of the armchairs Annette!</em>

Gathering the last of her strength she pushed all her weight against the door, managing to crack it open slightly before sending whatever blockage was in front of her door to tumble sideways, completely obstructing her from opening it any further. <em>Great....</em> From what she could see between the cracked open door and the darkness, it was a total mess. She couldn&#39;t even get in! Looks like she had to return to Ashe now-

The thought made her blush a bit. <em>Or I head downstairs and sleep in one of the-</em> Oh Annette... you fool.... Honest to a fault, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to break her friends trust.

After tossing and turning for a minute he was tempted to get back up and clean his room a bit more... But the thought of how upset Annette would be if she came back and saw him exerting himself was more than enough to dissuade him.

As he lay in his bed, now wide awake, he wondered if Annette would be coming back... Of course, he hoped her room was ok for her sake, but he was also concerned with what solutions there would even be if it wasn&#39;t livable... Where else could she even sle-- <em>Oh.</em> Though he was by himself, he reflexively covered his face in embarrassment just at the thought. Even so, he had no other ideas - perhaps part of him didn&#39;t WANT to find another solution... <em>Oh, Goddess help me...</em> Suddenly he hoped even more desperately that she wouldn&#39;t come back tonight. 

Just then, as if to spite him and his prayers, he heard a knock at the door once again. She couldn&#39;t even GET INTO her room?! What kind of terrible luck... &quot;That... That&#39;s... I-I&#39;m sorry to hear that...&quot; In all his years of combat he had never faced a battle like this... &quot;Er... Well...

He didn&#39;t just say what she thought he said, right? That must have been her imagination. Calming herself from what felt like being close to a heart attack, Annette waved her hands.

&quot;I- I can just- I can.. I could get one of the armchairs and-&quot; a mess of words followed by a yawn tumbled out of her mouth in an attempt to- well, what was she even attempting. &quot;You need to rest- I shouldn&#39;t uhm... <em>bother</em> you.&quot; It&#39;s not like she never shared a bed with someone before. Mercedes and her would often share a bed, during the war, she often shared the bed with her frightened mother, <em>heck</em>, she even shared a bed with Hilda once when they took a nap. So <em>why</em> was the thought of simply sharing the bed with Ashe pulling a melody on her heartstrings that sounded both chaotic and luring?

Hesitantly, she approached Ashe&#39;s bed, checking his temperature again before removing the handkerchief from his forehead. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to be a bother, Ashe.&quot; It felt different to when she was pampering him. Gaze avoiding his face and blush still residing on her cheeks. &quot;I <em>could</em> still just sleep in one of the armchairs in the common room-- but I know you wouldn&#39;t want me to.&quot; It&#39;s not like she could blame him. It was probably fair to honour his request to <em>not</em> sleep in an armchair when she was already straining her muscles with the healing work at the clinic. &quot;Just- I mean... If you really.... <em>really</em> don&#39;t mind... I&#39;d appreciate it if I could stay here for tonight.&quot; She had no more energy to fight against falling sleep for much longer.
