It was sharp but it wasn&#39;t overboard, casual enough for a simple morning out on the town. He would take a moment to brush his messy locks to the side as he would scan around for the woman of the hour.

Hibiscus.

What were his feelings towards Hibiscus? It was the million dollar question wasn&#39;t it? He wasn&#39;t going to <em>lie</em> and say that he didn&#39;t find her attractive, was he? He would never, she was cute! Her personality was adorable and she was a very considerate person who was constantly working to monitor and take care of everyone as much as she could, he almost felt bad that she would keep checking on him over and over again so something like this was the least he could do to pay her back.

Was there something more? Time <em>does</em> always tell. 

As soon as his target was spotted he&#39;d push himself off of the wall with his trademark grin; A slight two finger wave would mark it. &quot;Yo, sleep well?&quot; A cheerful and friendly tone without missing a beat, he was far too used to all this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just an outing as friends. Tequila was just being nice.</em> That were the thought running through her head, yet her heartbeat was ringing in her ears. This is the first time she&#39;s really going out <em>just because</em>. Hibiscus only heard about stories from others or in various types of media, but between doting on her sister and Rhodes, she barely ever had a moment to spare about her own <em>&quot;love life&quot;</em>. Heck, she didn&#39;t even know what to wear! She kindly refused Aak&#39;s labcoat offer and decided to just wear the same outfit she wore since she came here, more or less.

This would definitely be a learning experience for her... And who to learn from best if not a <em>master flirt</em>. There was no denying Tequila&#39;s charm was <em>hard</em> to resist. Irresistible some might even say. His handsome face definitely helped him as well... 

Still, she knew there was more to that. He was kind and thoughtful. Like giving her a run down about &quot;dates&quot; knowing she never went. That&#39;s nice and thoughtful. Nothing more, right? <em>Right?</em> It&#39;s not like she disliked him- she liked everyone at Rhodes. He&#39;s just- <em>Tequila</em>!

As he approached, Hibiscus returned his greeting with a smile. &quot;Good morning, Tequila.&quot; <s>She was fighting the urge to yawn.</s> &quot;I&#39;ve slept well, yes. I hope you did too. You promised, after all!&quot; Good thing she didn&#39;t make the same promise because she was straight up lying. &quot;Whats the schedule for uh today?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="11-Aug-22 12:12 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I haven&#39;t done this in awhile so my aim might be a little off after all this time, make sure to give me a rating out of ten when we&#39;re done.&quot; A slight breath from him work mark his dissatisfaction with himself before he continued to speak. 

&quot;I figured we could just do something simple, yeah?

&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound awful does it? If you&#39;re not feeling it just let me know, a first date shouldn&#39;t be something like a Co-op Hot Springs trip or anything crazy like that- Unless...

Though I will make sure to give you overall feedback at the end.&quot; Hearing his flirting rather than just reading it was always <em>worse.</em> In what way? Indescribable. Still, she couldn&#39;t help but smile at least a little.

As he kept going on about the plans, Hibiscus was actually a little surprised. He certainly seemed to have done his research. Unlike her. &quot;I didn&#39;t know there was a cafe around. That sounds nice. Oh did you have breakfast yet? We should go get breakfast before getting some supplies. If you go shopping while hungry you will buy more than you actually need.&quot; Breakfast and a coffee could definitely help her stay awake without any looming suspicion. She tugged at her hair a little as Tequila continued, making mental notes about the &quot;dos&quot; and &quot;don&#39;ts&quot; of going on dates.

&quot;I think it all sounds lovely, Tequila. Thank you for putting in so much thought.&quot; She&#39;s heard about the Hot Springs but hadn&#39;t had the time to visit. Maybe she could take the girls or all of Rhodes Island on a trip there one day. Not today thought. &quot;I am no expert, but I heard people talk about going to watch a movie, or have a picnic or go to eat somewhere... well for a real date at least.&quot; Her lips were painted with a sheepish smile as she looked down ever so slightly. There was a hint of embarrassment in her expression. Hopefully she wouldn&#39;t be too much of a fool for her first date-training-test-run.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s a nice little cafe; It isn&#39;t anything fancy but they do smoothies alongside the usual Cafe staples like coffee, tea, your usual food.

Upon his reaction to her questioning the <em>nature</em> of their outing, Hibiscus looked back up, focusing in his face. Right. She should look at him more.

&quot;Right. A <em>real date.</em> Sorry.&quot; It was like a play date! Silly Hibiscus. What was she ever worried about. She lost her head and read so much into it thanks to everyone talking about <em>love</em> and <em>feeling</em>. Tequila said he hadn&#39;t been on a date for a while. It was just practice for the both of them! <em>Noted and commited to memory.</em> &quot;Shall we go then? Do we hold hands? Do people do that on the first date?

It thankfully wasn&#39;t very far from here.

A lot of effort put into ensuring a very specific type of environment and it was certainly paying off for some people as a modest group of patrons lingered inside.

&quot;See?

She&#39;d hold it. No big deal! She holds her coworker&#39;s hands when they need it all the time! No need to fuzz about holding hands with <em>Tequila</em>. With that train of thought settled, she took a hold of his hand and follows alongside him.

It made her wonder why she was even worried in the first place... This is easy! It was actually pretty nice to walk around holding hands like that, not just to comfort people. Hibiscus tried not to let her mind wander too far, but seeing the city under those circumstances just felt a lot more interesting, especially since she would usually only run back and forth to the same few locations.

When they made it to the cafe, Hibiscus was amazed by how cute and cozy it looked. She was so amazed she didn&#39;t even notice she was gasping! &quot;Oh this is beautiful! Can we sit outside? The weather is so lovely and this place is so gorgeous!&quot; Big eyes sparkling with excitement we&#39;re looking up at Tequila. Hibiscus couldn&#39;t wait to try their menu.

Tequila would lower his free arm; Giving a mock bow as he spoke again. &quot;It shall be done, Madam.&quot; He playfully teased before going to take a seat at one of the outside tables, settling in rather quickly. &quot;I actually rather sitting outside, whenever I head out to the gym I always skate by here to grab a drink before heading off so I rarely stick around in the building itself.&quot; A hand would reach across to grab a menu, passing her one as he continued. &quot;I haven&#39;t actually sat down and <em>ate</em> here beyond some takeaway but one of my staff said it was pretty good, plus it fits your taste or at least I believe your taste?&quot;

It seemed to be a rather health focused menu! All kinds of caf&#233; foods listed there along with the usual coffee, tea, shakes, and the addition of various smoothies. &quot;If I&#39;m off mark we have all the more reason to <em>talk</em> about what you like, don&#39;t we? Anything on there that you fancy?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Oh. She was wrong. His little bow and calling her *madam</em> was unexpected. Even for Tequila&#39;s standards. It flustered her a little, laughing it off as she sat down.

It was no secret that Hibiscus favoured healthy food. <s>The fact she seemingly had no fucking taste buds compared to her coworkers however...</s> &quot;It all sounds really good.&quot; Tearing her gaze away from Tequila to scan the menu again, Hibiscus brooded over what to pick for herself... &quot;I&#39;d really like to try one of the smoothies, but a coffee is probably best.

Sigh. She was pretty adorable wasn&#39;t she? Ah- Dammit.

A moment would pass before he would make his return, handing her the requested coffee with a <em>giant</em> smoothie in his hand, Tequila sipping on it. &quot;We&#39;ll ask for yours before we go, I&#39;ve got it all sorted.&quot; He&#39;d say before pointing the straw in her direction. &quot;Want a taste?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hibiscus waited for him to go inside and if she could scream right now she would. <s>Tachanka get out of her HEAD.</s> In an attempt to calm down, she covered her face with her hands, leaned forward and a <em>long</em> deep breath. <em>It&#39;s fine Hibi, you&#39;re just tired. It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. It&#39;S FINE.</em> Her hands fell into her lap as she leaned back, face towards the sky to exhale that breath she held. <em>Not a date. Not a date. Not Tequila.

A few more deep breaths and her hands desperately fanning her face later, Hibiscus straightened her posture and her clothes before Tequila could get back. <em>Coffee.</em> As she took the coffee she uttered a quiet thank you before immediately lifting the cup to her lips. Before she could take a sip, Tequila offered his smoothie to her. &quot;What was it... Pinapple-Orange-Mango? It does sound tropical. Definitely suits you.&quot; <em>Suits you? It&#39;s a SMOOTHIE HIbiscus.</em> &quot;I&#39;d like to give it a try.&quot; She actually wanted to. She was curious about all the smoothies. &quot;I&#39;d offer you my coffee, but... You can have some of my smoothie later if you like.&quot; 

She set down the coffee before reaching for the straw, gently holding it as she took a quick sip from his smoothie. The combination was definitely tropical, it was fresh and juicy and rich in flavour and full of vitamins! An excited little squeal escapes her as she leans back, cupping her face. &quot;Wow!

Though I guess there is not much <em>beach</em> for the <em>boys</em> to be had here.&quot; If the sea wasn&#39;t supposedly lurking with monsters she&#39;d love to take everyone on a day out at the beach. Maybe they could clean out the ocean! Or at least a part of it. Her brows furrowed a little and a quiet yawn escaped her. Quickly, she covered her mouth before taking another sip of her coffee. &quot;It&#39;s only fair. You let me taste your smoothie, so if you want to you can have a taste of mine too.&quot; Setting aside her cup, she watched Tequila reclaim his smoothie. Taking a sip. <em>Gasp... indirect kiss?</em> Why did <em>that</em> just cross her mind? Why did <em>that</em> bother her? She gives everyone goodnight kisses but <em>that&#39;s</em> getting to her now?! 

Her shoulders seemed to tense up a little at the thought of a- <em>Oh, Omelette!</em> Thank god, their food arrived. Hibiscus too gave the water a smile paired with a nod before her gaze fell onto the big yellow protein bomb in front of her. Omelettes were a good source of energy. Just what she needed. As Tequila spoke, Hibiscus already reached for the cutlery. &quot;Oh we can just cut it in ha- EH? F-<em>Feed me</em>!?&quot; How... was that a date or uhm a couple thing? She was used to helping people eat or feed them when they were under her care for one reason or another but... on a date? &quot;I&#39;m- sorry...

Is it too much to ask for a place to bust out the swimsuit, god?

Putting away that indirect kiss that he <em>stole away</em> from Hibiscus her confusion would only serve to brighten his day, tail visibly flickering back and forth as he would lean on his elbows with that cheerful grin. “It’s not like anyone does that on the first date either-“ A slight pause as he’s set up his plate before the Perros spoke up once again. “It’s just something some people do to show their affection- It’s like spoiling someone, not every couple does it.” Such a sweet and innocent woman, she was. “I will say- Something in you just triggers and urge in me to spoil you rotten.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

HGN...</em> &quot;To show affection?&quot; The look on her face was puzzled, but the more she thought about it, the more she compared it to taking care of her sister when sick, the more sense it makes. Sort of... kinda... Still, that was different. Lava was her sister, her family, she felt a different sort of affection and love to her than she would feel to anyone else. They would always be there for each other!

Spoiling people, she could do that well. She was about to comment on that, lips parting to let out words, that only ended up stuck in her throat as she met his gaze, and <em>heard his words.</em> &quot;Spoil me rotten?&quot; A flustered laugh follows, before she grabs the cutlery to split the omelette between them. &quot;You can&#39;t do that. That&#39;s <em>my</em> job, Tequila.&quot; If anyone was gonna spoil anybody it would be her spoiling him! No competition accepted. Cutting away at the omelette, Hibiscus began to eat. <em>Could need some more salt...</em> Once finished chewing the first bite, she looks back at him. &quot;I already told you I would spoil you rotten.

Breakfast was after all the most important meal of the day, and eating together with others was in fact good for your health and mood! It was a win win overall to eat with Tequila. The slight disappointment evident in his drooping ears made her want to coddle him. Was it bad that she had the sudden urge to pet his head and scratch him behind the ears??- because the urge was there. 

His follow up had planted the seed in her head of <em>them</em> together again- no... it was already planted, he just watered it. <em>no, no ... he was not the type for something serious, was he? He&#39;s just joking! Just theoretically speaking!</em> It was Tequila... they were... friends? They were co-workers. It&#39;s not that she didn&#39;t like him. Sure, she would <em>complain</em> about his teasing, but part of her enjoyed it. It&#39;s unlike anything ever did to her. It was new, and it was fun--- <em>but it was Tequila!</em> If he was being serious, maybe her reactions would be different...

Hibiscus quietly continued to eat before chuckling at his last comment. Lifting a finger as if to warn him, she began to explain: &quot;Of course that&#39;s a threat. I will spoil you rotten and pamper you <em>so much</em> you won&#39;t be able to go a day without it!&quot; Not commenting on the very last part of his words, she just tilts her head with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll spoil you so much you won&#39;t be able to stop thinking about me and oversalt all your food!&quot; <em>Wow... what a threat...</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she would struggle with the inner-dilemma that he had posed to her rather casually he would hum to himself in satisfaction as he would finally lean back and sip away at his drink, noting the finger of warning with a glance as she would continue to explain. He really did feel bad that she was making this <em>so</em> easy for him to respond, maybe he should pull back on the acceleration. With the <em>deadly</em> threat of <em>&#39;I&#39;ll spoil you so much you won&#39;t be able to stop thinking about me!&#39;</em> He would coyly raise an eyebrow before setting his drink back down, arm thrown over the back of his chair. &quot;Oh no. I won&#39;t be able to stop thinking about a beautiful woman. Woe is me.&quot; He&#39;d say <em>very</em> sarcastically. &quot;It&#39;s like you want me to fall for you?

He was such a difficult guy to read! Always smiling, always flirting, always charming. To her it felt like Tequila could read her like an open book while he was and enigma with his own weird locks and keys and passwords!

Her lips pressed into a thin line in embarrassment, leaning back as she reached for her coffee again to empty it even if by now there was but a slightly bitter concentrated drop in the cup - not bitter enough to make her flinch though. &quot;Oh you-!

Tequila wouldn&#39;t even dare go anywhere <em>near</em> W. She not only had a ton of &#39;Bad Baggage&#39; with Rhodes Island she was also liable to seriously harm him, pass.

&quot;As for the bar...

&quot;If you want to be technical I have <em>flirted</em> with people while I&#39;m behind the bar but that&#39;s more for entertainment and less me actually hitting on them, like I do for you.&quot; He&#39;d point his finger at her as he took another sip out of his drink, he was pretty much done eating now so the perro was free to sip away happily.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She really looked like an idiot right now, didn&#39;t she? The coffee definitely helped her to stay awake, but it was also making her unexpectedly jittery. Maybe it was Tequi- no.. no it was the coffee.... ok maybe it was both. Hibiscus tried to treat this so casually, but Tequila&#39;s teasing and flirting just makes her heart do cartwheels, she doesn&#39;t even know how to think straight. When he counted her among the <em>pretty</em> ladies of Rhodes Island, she smiled sheepishly. It was not as if she thought she wasn&#39;t pretty - she thought Lava was pretty, and since they&#39;re twins, she&#39;s too by default - but it was always <em>different</em> hearing it from somebody else.

&quot;Hm so...&quot; A finger tapped against her cheek. &quot;If it&#39;s different because you&#39;re working... and we both work at Rhodes Island...&quot; She almost felt ridiculous to ask the question that followed. &quot;-- are we .. being unprofessional? By going on a date? I&#39;m not getting you in trouble for going on a date with you, am I!?&quot; This shouldn&#39;t be so bad, right? After all, there&#39;s people not getting in trouble for worse, in addition to that, they weren&#39;t even in their own world... surely this won&#39;t be a problem... Heck, their coworkers even encouraged it. <em>Oh, now her mind was running laps again...</em>

Fingers wander from her cheek to pinch the bridge of her nose, eyes closing for only a moment. &quot;Maybe I&#39;m just not made for dating...&quot; Hibiscus felt... confused. Evidently, she knew of Tequila&#39;s charms and she&#39;s heard a fair share of stories about him but it made her realise that she didn&#39;t <em>actually</em> know him, as much as she thought she did. Signals were mixed due to her own inability to read situations of this nature, as well as how she had perceived him all this time. &quot;I should go grab my smoothie so we can head out whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Very. If I&#39;m behind the bar it&#39;s a very different environment to working at a Pharmaceutical Company together with someone and we&#39;re co-workers, not client and worker.&quot; He&#39;d try to re-assure her but he&#39;s very certain that at this rate this kind of girl would quickly bury herself into a pile of her deepest, inner thoughts.

&quot;You&#39;re just overthinking it a little... I&#39;ve admittedly spent a little too much time complimenting you- Oops?&quot; He&#39;d say with a friendly shrug. &quot;Normally... It&#39;d be a far more casual affair where we&#39;re just getting to know each other.&quot; He&#39;d lean back for a second and hum to himself in thought, what would Tequila even find himself <em>asking</em> her? Her cooking? Motivations? Desire? Friends? A whole list of things that he could really use to dig into her head, that might be a walk conversation.

As she would make the suggestion Tequila would nod as he&#39;d go to stand. &quot;I&#39;ve already handled everything else so you just need to go in and ask for it, it&#39;s under my name. If you get it we can go for a quick walk through the marketplace and maybe I can quiz you about yourself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The guilt of getting him in trouble- she would feel really bad! Knowing he, and by extend Hibiscus as well, would not get in trouble for dating was reassuring. Still, the actual dating part was rather overwhelming. She couldn&#39;t help but agree with his claim of her <em>verthinking</em> things. She felt like that&#39;s all she has been doing today. &quot;You really have been stepping on the gas. It feels like everything you said you did to compliment or tease me. It&#39;s making my head explode...&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Tequilla.&quot; With that, she too stood up and, diligent as she was, Hibiscus gathered the cutlery on the table to carry it inside as she went to grab her smoothie. A moment away made her think about what she&#39;d like to know about him... she knew he likes to skate, and running the bar and the workshop... maybe she could ask about his favourite food? That would be good to know so she could make it for him!

As she returned with her smoothie she looked... <em>a little</em> disappointed. It was good and healthy, but it tasted a little bland. Tequila&#39;s was a lot better with the sour tropical fruits. Next time, she&#39;d definitely pick a different one. &quot;Alright, ready to go!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sigh. He can&#39;t wait until he can go completely hands off with this whole affair, it&#39;s a long struggle to hit that point though.

As she would finally return his ears would perk up a little, smiling back at her with another little mock bow before digging a free hand into his pocket. &quot;Shall I escort you again?&quot; He&#39;d offer a hand to her with one, final little tease before motioning to set off down the nearby street hand taken or not- Hopefully she&#39;d follow him!

Tequila was <em>very</em> particular with the specific time that he thought to invite her out as they would head out; Why? Well... A few of the locals of the city would set up their stalls along the way of the stalls that are normally littered with fast food with more fresh produce, personal crafts, works, and even a little bit of a cheeky pass by the flower shop. &quot;I have to ask, actually.

Seeing this side of the city, or any other side really, was fun. Hibiscus only left the Rhodes Island base for two things these days - groceries and lunch deliveries. Same routes, same old. &quot;Hm?

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t like stuff with too much sugar, that&#39;s bad for your teeth and bad for your figure. I like all sorts of vegetables, since they basically all taste the same, and fruits, especially sour strawberries... <em>oh!</em> chillies too!

Spice is fun, I don&#39;t mind spice.&quot; He&#39;d shrug before glancing back at her between the passing stalls. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;d say they all taste the same though...&quot; He&#39;d almost seem to hum. &quot;Preparation. Style of cooking, all that stuff can make a real impact on taste and texture.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her gaze was glued on his face as he tried her smoothie and once more she briefly asked herself how one person could be so mesmerisingly good looking. God damn it Tequila... &quot;Yeah..
