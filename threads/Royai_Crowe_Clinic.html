Panic settles as the thought of losing her crosses his mind. <em>He failed to protect her.</em> He should have gone straight to her, not into the fray.

Her clothes are still stained with his blood, her eyes swollen from fighting a losing battle against tears. It feels like Lust all over again, except this is worse, it&#39;s <em>worse</em>, it&#39;s so much worse, because she is stuck in a painful limbo of wondering if <em>this is it</em>. She is helpless and frustrated and all she can do is wait.

Currently, she is dozing in the chair next to him, arms cradling her head as she rests them on the bed near his feet-- right up until the moment she feels him stir, before he can even get her name out. Always her first for him, it seems. <em>Idiot</em>, she thinks, but it&#39;s a fond and gentle thought as she slips her hand carefully into his, blinking rapidly to fight the tears of relief and regret in equal measure that threaten to spill.

&quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; A quiet affirmation-- she&#39;s here now, but she should have been there to stop this. If he hadn&#39;t been coming to see her, he wouldn&#39;t have been near the battlefield. If she had been faster, she could have protected him somehow. That&#39;s her job; that&#39;s her penance; that&#39;s her <em>purpose</em>. His burning hands had freed her from the weight on her back. In return, she is supposed to watch <em>his</em>.

The pain in his voice settles like a stone in her gut. &quot;Here.&quot; Riza releases his hand momentarily and grabs the cup of water by the bedside, maneuvering the straw towards his mouth. &quot;Slow sips, the doctor said. Don&#39;t gulp.&quot;

He was already on his way to see her when he first felt something was wrong. Why did he turn back? Maybe he wasn&#39;t ready yet. Maybe he wasn&#39;t ready <em>then</em>. No, he was just looking for excuses. Looking for excuses as to why he&#39;d neglect his duty to protect her. The fear and guilt of the unforgivable should anything happen to her were quickly washed away like a crashing ocean wave against a cliff the moment he heard her voice and felt her touch. It was enough to loosen the tension in all his muscles, a relief of pain, giving him the strength to lightly squeeze her hand.

It&#39;s what she&#39;s always done. Give him strength. He couldn&#39;t have it this far without her. Riza was the steering wheel that would guide him, the anchor that would bind him, the wind that would follow him - she was the journey, the past, the present, <em>his future</em>... their future. If he was hesitant then, he was more certain than ever now. There was no stress, no tension, just calm. For now. Still, he knew, if something like this should happen again, there&#39;s no telling if he&#39;d make it out alive. If he would fail to protect her again. Roy needed her to know everything. All the things he&#39;s been meaning to tell her.

After she assisted him to drink some water, slow sips like instructed, Roy forced himself to turn his head towards her regardless of the pain. &quot;Thank you... I...&quot; Blurry vision slowly putting the pieces together, clearing up to finally reveal her, and every detail come crashing like another wave, colder and much harsher like the slap of a whip. &quot;You-!&quot; Remnants of tears tainting her cheeks and he knew he&#39;d have to apologize for that. Then... when he saw the blood, he almost choked on his own breath. &quot;You&#39;re- blood. Are you bleeding? Are you alright?&quot;

It&#39;s the same feeling of failure she&#39;d felt after the first true battle with the homunculi. (His bleeding hand had gripped hers weakly then, too.) 

It&#39;s through sheer force of will that she keeps herself from crumbling onto her knees and begging for his forgiveness, though she knows him well enough that he will insist that there&#39;s nothing to forgive, that she&#39;d done her best. It&#39;s cold comfort when she&#39;s sitting here physically unharmed and as of five minutes ago she was unsure if he&#39;d ever wake up. 

His question causes her brow to furrow and she looks down at herself-- she&#39;d forgotten all about the blood on her clothes. &quot;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s not mine.&quot; Her voice is strained, throat tight, and her gaze remains firmly on where their hands are joined. If she looks at him now she just <em>knows</em> her composure will turn to dust, and she cannot allow herself to add to his burdens. &quot;I carried you. To-- to get away from the battlefield.&quot;

That... was his blood. It would explain why he&#39;d feel so faint. Of course, with the hit he took, it&#39;s a surprise he&#39;s even awake by now. Roy was disappointed in himself. The sound of her voice, so fragile... he didn&#39;t like it... and it was <em>his</em> fault. &quot;I&#39;ve done it again... haven&#39;t I?&quot; His head rolls back for him to stare at the ceiling, eyes closing as he breathes out some of the anger he had for himself.

&quot;I&#39;ve made you worry... and ended up hurting you, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Roy wasn&#39;t talking about physical injuries - he was talking about tearing up emotional scars. He let the images of his hatred flood his mind... Lust, Envy, Father- just how many times had he nearly gotten himself killed? How many times did Riza suffer from him incompetence? <em>Enough is enough.</em> He wanted to be the reason of happiness and laughter, the only tears she wants her to spill being tears of joy, yet he&#39;s making her worry again and again and again...

Roy takes a deep breath before opening his eyes again but his gaze is fixed to the ceiling. &quot;I hope you can forgive me....&quot; The words slip out but her name dies on his lips. Had he even earned the right to call her by her name? <em>Oh he so hoped he had....</em> There were still things he needed to say. Things he wanted to discuss... he was itching to tell her, impatience burning inside him, wanting to spill it out- His thoughts temporarily drift back to the gifts that are, as far as he is concerned, are buried somewhere beneath some rubble in the city. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for making you wait. I should have been there sooner... maybe I wouldn&#39;t have lost your presents then... now look at me, in a hospital bed, empty handed, making you cry. What a pathetic man I am...&quot;

She settles for gently sweeping the hair away from his forehead with her fingertips, and if she lingers a little, just presses her toe against that line in the sand they&#39;ve drawn, it can be chalked up to exhaustion and relief, right? They can easily pretend to forget about it tomorrow.

His guilt seems to pull her shoulders down with the weight-- not only has she failed in her job of protecting him, but he&#39;s blaming himself for it. &quot;This isn&#39;t your fault,&quot; she states resolutely, though exhaustion seems to fray the edges just a little. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone put &#39;giant space rhino&#39; on their list of things to expect this evening, sir. I should have been faster to find you, to cover your back. I knew something was up and I shouldn&#39;t have just... waited. Please don&#39;t blame yourself for my failures, and wait a moment-- did you say presents?&quot; 

She can&#39;t help the small snort of laughter that escapes her. It&#39;s such a <em>silly</em> thing to be worried about, and yet it&#39;s so very... him. &quot;Did you get drunk and buy an entire flower stand again?&quot; For just a moment, she can escape back into their easy rapport, back into that gentle and familiar ribbing like she&#39;s hiding under a comfortable blanket. Even if that memory is of the awful time she spent as Wrath and Pride&#39;s hostage, it&#39;s still one she looks on fondly. His uncanny timing and gentle care for her are bright spots in those dark times, like stars scattered in the void of night. 

&quot;I still don&#39;t own a vase.&quot;

A taste of what could be... He listens to her take the blame, but he knew that was wrong. He was at fault. He was the one that ran into the fray without waiting for her, without looking for her. It was his fault, and his fault alone. She was already weary of the situation and he just made her worry more.

The sound of her laughter in a moment like this set fireworks off inside him. His head rolls over to the side again, gaze fixed on her as she recalls moments from their memory, a memory Roy had thought about not too long ago himself, and he smiles weakly. That feeling, the familiarity, the nostalgia. She was his reason to be alive and in love. &quot;I know... That&#39;s why one of the present was a vase. Handmade, of course... If you can count alchemy as hand made... The roses looked pretty good in it.&quot; Beautiful even, but he felt he had boasted enough. 

He looked at her and, while the truth he learned here from Du&#39;slk had shattered his dreams, <em>she</em> was his new dream. An old dream, really, given how he had never really stopped chasing her. A dream he hoped could become a reality. A dream he feared to become a nightmare. His brows furrowed at the thought. He wasn&#39;t sure how to approach the topic now. He did have a speech prepared, but much like his gifts, it was lost and nowhere to be found. He might have to wing it.

It&#39;s just... such a silly thing for him to worry about now, after almost dying to a giant space rhino, and yet it&#39;s so very like him. It&#39;s part of the reason she adores him. As a friend, of course. Even now, there&#39;s a boundary between them. &quot;And roses. You know, sir, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say you were trying to be romantic--&quot; 

Her words screech to a halt as things click into place. The presents, the delay, his words... they all make sense now. The Lieutenant isn&#39;t blind; she is aware of the dance they&#39;ve both done for years around each other, like asymptote lines, closer and closer and closer but never actually making contact because they <em>can&#39;t</em>. Maybe somewhere out there, in one of the many multiverses, there&#39;s a version of her that can have that dream of happiness with the man she loves with all her heart, but she doesn&#39;t believe it is this one. The Amestrian military code is very clear about fraternization. And even if it weren&#39;t, the scandal of a superior officer in a romantic relationship with his subordinate would destroy any chance he has at becoming the leader of their country. 

&quot;We <em>can&#39;t</em>, Roy.&quot; And God, she hates how her voice shakes; she is trembling with the effort of not reaching out to him. &quot;If we-- If I-- I couldn&#39;t let go again.

If he could move, he&#39;d clutch his chest, feeling his heart beat fast against his ribcage. If he didn&#39;t knew better he could swear it was trying to escape and jump into her hands, gifting itself to her, begging for love.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">I couldn&#39;t let go again.</code> At that, his heart skipped a beat, calming down for a moment as he looked at her, eyes ever so curious awaiting what happens next.

They went through hell and back to persue this dream, but this <em>hell</em> they can not come <em>back</em> out of... 

He felt the motivation behind her words, felt the emotions to their very core, and he was furious about it too. &quot;It&#39;s... too late.&quot; He starred at the ceiling, muscles tense and sending pain throughout his entire body, but it was nothing compared to his inner turmoil. &quot;Du&#39;slk...&quot; at the mention of their name, Roy felt anger growing, not at them in particular, but at the <em>truth</em>.

To atone for our sins, for everything we did. The future we seek...&quot; Anger was bubbling up in his throat again even though he promised himself to be calm before.

A whole speech prepared, and it was all for the gutter now as emotions took the reign over his words and actions. &quot;It&#39;s impossible. We can not leave this place. There&#39;s no way out. I used one of my wishes, wishing for the absolute truth to know if we can ever leave this place but...&quot; He took a deep breath, ending his sentence right there.

Hurting him is the last thing she wants to do, and yet here she is, with clumsy hands and tongue letting the blades of her guilt and self-loathing cut him too, and worst of all she can&#39;t seem to stop it. Those feelings have propelled her forward for so many years like timber on a slow-burning fire beneath her feet, a flame she knows will consume her eventually, but it&#39;s a fate she&#39;s accepted. Their victory would always end in their trial and she would be held accountable for every drop of blood she&#39;d spilled during the Ishvalan War. It is the very least of what she deserves for her crimes. Hearing that it&#39;s for <strong>nothing</strong> and they are stuck and there will be no justice for the lives she&#39;s ended... Riza feels waves of nausea rolling in her stomach and there&#39;s a rushing sound in her ears and suddenly:

(cw burning, war, self-harm kinda?, suicidal thoughts) <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><em>Riza struggles to sleep in the cold desert tent. Sand and dust prevent her from taking deep breaths to try and relax, and she is stuck trying to sleep on her stomach on the thin bedroll they&#39;ve provided. Each movement causes a deep, hot sting under the thick bandages where burning hands had touched, yet the sensation makes her giddy. It&#39;s only a small portion of her back in spite of her pleading tearfully for him to destroy it all (she knows he&#39;s right, any more might put her at risk of going into shock), yet she feels lighter than she has in years-- the burden her father placed on her back has gone up in smoke, and for a moment, she is not drowning under the weight of the sins she&#39;s committed.</em>

<span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><em>She&#39;s in her bare East City apartment after the war. The early morning sun spills through the window onto her bedroll and her back rests against a wall. Sleep is an elusive enemy that she only succumbs to when she&#39;s quite literally too exhausted to move. Every time she closes her eyes she sees faces through a scope, watching her, <strong>judging</strong>. In her lap lies a loaded pistol; she&#39;s lost count of the times she&#39;s thought of pulling that trigger and embracing the dark. Riza isn&#39;t sure what stops her-- the thought that she does not deserve such an easy out, or her own cowardice. She hates both.</em></span>

<span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">*Her entire body jolts at the sharp knocking. &quot;Warrant Officer Riza Hawkeye?&quot; A man&#39;s voice asks. &quot;You have new deployment orders.&quot; The messenger slips an envelope under her door, and it&#39;s not until she hears his retreating footsteps that she moves to read it, her hands shaking. <strong>Ordered to report to Eastern Headquarters under your new commanding officer--*</strong></span>

<span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><em>&#39;Colonel Roy Mustang, huh?&#39; She asks no one, the name causing her voice to go tight with something unfamiliar, and somewhere in the dark of her mind, a spark lights up.</em></span>

Suddenly she&#39;s back in the present and being torn in two. &quot;I can&#39;t--&quot; Her tongue feels like lead in her mouth and she stares at him: the eyes she&#39;s looked to for comfort and hope since the day of her father&#39;s funeral, and the smile that&#39;s made her stomach flutter since he&#39;d first knocked on the door of her childhood home. Hot, angry tears are stinging at the corners of her eyes, blurring him away, and she knows she&#39;s going to hurt them both. Perhaps her father had the right idea; maybe she&#39;s not meant for this. She&#39;s a human weapon with the instructions for burning the world to ash etched into her skin, made only for others to use in the pursuit of destruction. &quot;I don&#39;t <em>deserve</em> this.

It would have all lead to this. He could ignore his own tears, always has, always will, but the look of panic on her face was breaking his heart... and it was his fault. He shouldn&#39;t have said it... he shouldn&#39;t have said anything. No matter how dangerous this world, no matter how easily he could get into a situation like that again, ending up needing urgent medical care, he should have just shut up. It has been a while that he asked Du&#39;slk about the truth, and it has been a while that he processed it and, as much as he struggled to cope with it in private, <em>witnessing</em> Riza&#39;s devastation made him wish he&#39;s just <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">died</span> with the truth fighting that Rhino, so he wouldn&#39;t have to hurt her like this. 

He swallows, taking deep breaths and forcing the tears that burned his cheeks to stay away. He&#39;s done it... again... he&#39;s hurt her. More than just hurt her. <em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">I can&#39;t...</code></em> Roy takes another deep breath, pleading for his voice to not crack under the pressure and pain. &quot;I know...&quot; It&#39;s true, she doesn&#39;t deserve it. None of this. 

Despite his ordered bedrest and his muscles screaming in pain, Roy forced himself to sit up. Every fibre of his being burned as he moved, muscles aching as the blood rushing through his ears screamed louder than <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">100 dying civilians</span>, but he didn&#39;t resist it. Roy has learned about the world the hard way and suffering has been his teacher, <em>he could take another lesson.</em> The moment he sat up straight, he drew in a sharp breath, almost slumping forward again. &quot;You deserve good things, Riza.&quot; With a little more strength, Roy is even able to lift his arm to wipe his own tears away before gathering the rest of his strength to look at <s>the woman he loves</s> Riza be in such pain.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-922960260619206746 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=922960260619206746><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Dec-21 10:14 PM">22:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;You don&#39;t deserve <em>this</em>.

You deserve a life in peace. A life in the countryside, without war... without the burden of alchemy.&quot; The pain in his sides stung but he&#39;d refuse to yield. Even if the scar he gave himself from fighting Lust would gnaw at him, he&#39;d bear it. &quot;If I could bear this burden for the both of us, I would. Trust me... I really would... but I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t take your pain away. I can&#39;t make the memories go away... It seems, I&#39;m only making it worse.&quot; He forced himself to chuckle at his own foolishness, causing his muscles to clench, sending a wave of pain through his body even he couldn&#39;t hide anymore. Clutching his sides, Roy almost toppled over. Through grit teeth, he took another deep breath. &quot;I&#39;m... sorry... for everything.&quot;
