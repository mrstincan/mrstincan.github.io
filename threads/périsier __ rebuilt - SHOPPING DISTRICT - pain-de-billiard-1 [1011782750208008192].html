Sure, her uncle always told her she was destined for greatness, a scholar or mage, but in a world so new and strange, maybe all she wanted to do was being a baker. 

A basked full of treats is nestled in her arms as she walks into the bakery, packaged goods piling up to the point of daring to escape. How she managed to open the door without dropping the basked was close to a miracle. &quot;Hello I am- -AGH!&quot; she stumbles over her own feet, hoisting up the basket to not drop the goods, as she regained her balance. She approached the counter with a huge smile, blue eyes sparkling in excitement. &quot;Phew...-- Uhm! I&#39;m Annette! Are you hiring?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As excited as he had been to try baking once he got a new body, now that that wish had been granted he felt a bit dissatisfied by the experience. It wasn’t like baking was any less fulfilling than he imagined, but not having Venom around to <s>annoy</s> talk to made the whole bakery experience a lot more lonely.

As such, the robot had been trying all sorts of things to keep himself busy - drawing, reading, writing a diary, tinkering with random junk he found on the streets - but none of it was a substitute for actual interaction with others. Social ostracization was nothing new to him - before meeting Bridget, then later Venom, he had been looked down on by just about everyone he met, seen as nothing more than a worthless pile of scrap discarded by his creators - but somehow being disrespected and mistreated was still preferable to being outright ignored.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="24-Aug-22 06:36 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1011855211825995867 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1011855211825995867><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Aug-22 06:31 AM">06:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>---------------------------------
In his latest attempt to give himself something to do, Robo-Ky had fully removed his head and laid it on the countertop to allow him to better inspect his own body. After all, it was still a mystery to him why it had been granted to him upon his arrival here. He had spent most of the last year prior to arriving here eagerly awaiting the time when Venom could afford to rebuild him, but popping into P&#233;risier with a brand new body already fully built had been a bit of an anticlimax, but taking some time to examine it might be helpful, or at least entertaining enough.

This was the compromising position Robo-Ky found himself in when Annette suddenly stumbled through the door with a mountain of pastries precariously held in her arms.  <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“WHAT THE HELL?! LADY, DIDN’T ANYONE EVER TEACH YA TO KNOCK?!”</code> he scrambled to put himself back together in an attempt to become at least slightly presentable. <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”UGH. SORRY ABOUT THAT. DIDN’T EXPECT TO GET ANY GUESTS.”</code>

As he fit his head back into its’ socket he turned his attention back to the new arrival, his jaw dropping as soon as he got a good look who had just walked in. <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”AWOOOGA! HEY THERE GORGEOUS, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY”</code> As Annette asked her question, his jaw somehow dropped even more dramatically, begging the question of how it was even attached to his head to begin with. <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”HIRING? HERE?? YOU WANNA WORK HERE? I MEAN, UH, HMMMMMM…. WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONSIDERING TAKING ON NEW EMPLOYEES… HAVE YA GOT A RESUME I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT?”</code>

I even made Annette hitch a breath, lips parting in a surprised gasp as she watched... she wasn&#39;t even sure what she just witnessed. Was he a golem!?  Back in her world, Annette had buried her nose in some ancient legends describing the mythical apparatus that ink on paper described as a golem, but she had never seen one before! Supposedly, they were weapons but... would a weapon open up a bakery? Did a weapon even have sentience to do so?

A moment passed before the woman realised she had been staring the entire time, watching as the... <em>person</em> in front of her had put themselves back together - quite literally. &quot;OH! OH GODDESS I&#39;M SO SORRY!!! I DIDN&#39;T MEAN TO BARGE IN!&quot; <em>Way to go, Annette. Terrible first impression!</em> Fumbling with the basket, adjusting its weight to make carrying it less straining, Annette felt quite embarrassed. --- <em>Even more so when she was greeted by an &#39;Awooga&#39;.</em> &quot;Aw- what!?&quot; Taken aback ever so slightly by the compliment, a hint of an embarrassed blush crept up her freckled cheeks - though her makeup would do a great job hiding it behind a perfect porcelain complexion.

&quot;They are all fresh- or well, as fresh as can be from making them to bringing them here... I guess that is the only <em>resume</em> I have to show for myself.&quot; Not like she had any official papers on her. Graduating from the Royal School of Sorcery and having studied at the Officers Academy did not seem to <em>benefit</em> in <em>this</em> situation. &quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t even introduced myself, silly me.&quot; Her lips wore an honest smile as she bowed gracefully. &quot;My name is Annette. My friends call me Annie. I would really enjoy working at a bakery like this.&quot;

His store was only lightly stocked since he wasn’t getting many customers, so the number of pastries in the store may as well have doubled when she stepped through the door. It wasn’t just the quantity which took him aback - each was intricately detailed in such a way as to make them almost overwhelmingly cute. Of course, he had no way of knowing how good the food tasted, but it was obvious from a glance just how much care and effort Annette had put into making them.

Finally recovering his train of thought, Robo-Ky spoke back up: <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”YOWZA! YOU MADE ALL OF THESE? BY YOURSELF? UH, YEAH, YOU’RE HIRED, DUH.”</code> The resume question was more of a joke than anything, he probably would have hired her no matter what - he was just that desperate for company - but it was immediately clear just how perfect a fit she was for the job. While his own baked goods certainly looked good, he was only copying exactly what he had seen Venom do so many times, and Venom had never really put much flair into the presentation. Annette’s creations could bring some very welcome improvements to the aesthetics of the bakery and its offerings. 

The robot noticed Annette’s shocked expression, presumably from the sight of him without his head. <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”OH, DON’T WORRY, EVERYTHING YOU SAW EARLIER WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL, NO NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO HARD. ANYWAY, INTRODUCTIONS. I’M THE SUPER HIGH ELECTRO JACK OF ALL TRADES, ROBO-KY! YOU CAN JUST CALL ME ROBO-KY. OR ROBO. OR WHATEVER YOU WANT HONESTLY. JUST NOT KY. NICE TA MEET’CHA, ANNIE!”</code> He said as he held his arm out over the table to shake her hand.

The young noble was confident in her abilities, but in the end, <em>he was the boss</em>, he would decide if he&#39;d hire her or not. After all, she just wanted to be able to have more people enjoy the products of her hobby! When he finally spoke up, clearly impressed, Annette began jumping out of joy. &quot;Really!? Hurray!&quot; Clapping her hands enthusiastically, the woman smiled brightly. &quot;Thank you! Ah- yes I made them all! I wanted to make sure I had something to show when I got here. It was a little bit of a hassle to get them all done before I came here, but it seems to have been worth it!&quot;

Incapable of stopping to smile, she looked around the store, imagining it filled with people eating her cakes and tarts, before she flashed her smile back to him. &quot;Robo-Ky?&quot; A gloved hand reached to tap her chin, trying to think of a nickname for him. However, she quickly dismissed the thought, thinking it rude to become too friendly with her employer too soon. &quot;Robo-Ky, I see! It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, and I am looking forward to working with you!&quot; Despite still being a little confuzzled about how exactly his body worked and why he was able to detach his head, she would try to not think about it just like he requested. For now, she&#39;d reach out and shake his hand in excitement.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I have seen you around before, ah... but I was also very shut-in at the guild, so I guess that is my fault.&quot; Her question is presented with an innocent smile. Annette knew there were a lot of people around outside the guild, including people from her own world, but she rarely got in touch with any of them. &quot;So, Robo-Ky, what inspired you to open a bakery?&quot;

As for her question, he replied, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”WELL, I DON’T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR REASON.

Being able to bake here, for others, and to share my happiness is one of the best opportunities I can have!&quot; The sorceress hadn&#39;t let go of his hand, absentmindedly shaking it during their conversation.

At first, she&#39;d just nod at his answer. The thought to be able to copy other people&#39;s skills! That seemed useful. If she could do that, she wouldn&#39;t have to study so hard, though she actually enjoyed studying it was time consuming and frustrating to not get things immediately. &quot;I see. Just for fun?

Letting go of his hand, she began tapping her chin. &quot;Well we shook on it, so is that enough? I remember signing up for the Academy took some paperwork, but I&#39;ve never had a job before... Knights in the King&#39;s service usually also had an official letter, but the knights in my uncle&#39;s service don&#39;t... Hm... Oh, speaking of that, when can I start?

He nodded thoughtfully as he released his grip - <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”A HANDSHAKE WORKS JUST FINE FOR ME!

A muffled <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">”AH, SHIT!!”</code> came from the disembodied head under the table as his torso bent town to reach around to find it. When he picked it up this time, rather than putting it back on his head right away he just held it in his arms.

With how busy things were at the guild every day, and how unpredictable this world was, having flexible hours was a real luxury. &quot;I see. That works for me. Thank you so much, Robo-Ky! I promise I won&#39;t let you down. I&#39;m your girl!&quot;

The sudden rattling and tumbling and losing of heads was a bit startling. It took her quite a moment to even follow what happened. By the time she bend down to help look for his head, Robo-ky had already found it. Blinking a few times at the sight of Robo-Ky&#39;s head being carried in his arms rather than on his shoulders, Annette mustered a polite smile. &quot;Ah... so this happens often?&quot; Would that be rude to ask? After all, she had never seen a construct like him before. They have just met, clearly it would be intrusive to pester him to talk about <em>what</em> he was and what he meant by <em>having a body again.</em> Still, while she had not uttered a word to carry those questions across, they were basically written all over her face.
